# SlicerSoundControl

3D Slicer extension to generate sound feedback for tool navigation. Demo video: https://youtu.be/gSz8IHmogMo

Sound is generated by PureData (http://puredata.info), an open source visual programming language for multimedia.
To modulate generated sound based on navigated instrument position, orientation, etc., 3D Slicer sends parameters using OpenSoundControl protocol.

**OpenSoundControl** module is for configuring and testing OpenSoundControl server communication.

**SoundNavigation** module is for automatic generation of OpenSoundControl messages for tool navigation, from tool and reference transform nodes.

It is recommended to download PureData distribution that includes plugins:

- https://github.com/agraef/purr-data/releases
- http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended (not maintained anymore but still working)

## Usage example: distance warning using breach warning module

This example explains how to set up sound warning, which indicates distance of a tool from a target structure. This example does not require tracking hardware, tool can be moved around using mouse+keyboard.

Installation:

- Install PureData
- Install 3D Slicer
- Start 3D Slicer
- Install SoundControl extension
- Install SlicerIGT extension (it contains BreachWarning module, which is used for computing distance of tooltip from a target model)

Setup:

- Start 3D Slicer
- Load BreachWarningScene.mrb
- Switch to "Open Sound Control module"
- In PureData section, select [OscSimpleTest.pd](https://github.com/SlicerIGT/SlicerSoundControl/blob/master/OpenSoundControl/Resources/OscSimpleTest.pd) configuration file. Then, look for the PureData executable file. This last one must be set at the "Advanced" part. Once that is done, click "Start server" button. You should be hearing now the alarm noise. If not, check the log messages.
- Switch to "Sound Navigation" module
- Move the needle model by shift+left click & drag => moving the needle closer to the target will increase the beeping frequency
